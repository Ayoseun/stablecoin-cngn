# WrapCBDC stablecoin - cNGN
## Abstract
Blockchains, or distributes ledgers, have quickly pained adoption as one of the most promising technologies to emerge in tne last ten years. They bring the potential to maintain public, yet secure, leaders of all sorts of data ranging from supply chains to voting records. Many governments and fortune 500 companies have started dedicated blockchain divisions to leverage the technology, including CBN Naira and others.

One of tne most promising uses of this new technology is its ability to act as an alternative payment rail. Similar to SWIFT, but available globally, more secure, and much faster at settling transactions. The Consortium Naira {cNGN) stablecoin emerges as an early leader in creating use-cases for tne CBN Naira at launch.

The cNGN is a compliant stablecoin backed 1:1 to the Naira with regulatory supervision by the CBN, SEC and relevant regulatory bodies, and enables licensed partners and exchanges to seamlessly convert cNGN to Naira and vice versa.
